        <h3 id="second-heading"> CATS AND RENTALS </h3>
        <p> There are plenty of exceptional tenants who want to live with their cats in a rental property. <span> Statistics show  </span> that
        there are 36 million households with cats, and approximately 30% of all the households in the US own cats.
        Because so many landlords ban all pets outright, there is a big demand for rental properties that allow them.

        upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at
        vacuum cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch. </p>
